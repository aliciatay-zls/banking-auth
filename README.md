# Go Banking Web App - Backend Auth Server

## Setup
1. Install MailHog: https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog

2. Configure environment variables.
   * Development: set values in the scripts in `scripts/` if not using the dummy values
   * Production: create a `.env` file at project root with the same keys as the scripts in `scripts/`

## Running the app (Development)
1. Ensure the db has been started in the [other repo](https://github.com/udemy-go-1/banking)

2. Open this repo in another project window.

3. In terminal, start the MailHog SMTP and backend auth servers:
   ```
   make dev
   ```
   In separate terminal tab, view logs for both in real-time without them interleaving:
   ```
    tail -f mailhog.log app.log
   ```
   On success, logs printed:
   * MailHog: will end with "Creating API v2 with WebPath:"
   * Backend auth server: will be an info-level log with the message "Starting auth server..."

4. [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) can be used to send requests to the app. Sample requests:
